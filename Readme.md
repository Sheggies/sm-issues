# Repository's purpose
This repository aims to centrally track reproducible bugs encountered within Scrap Mechanic and all its related tools.  
[Scrap Mechanic](https://www.scrapmechanic.com/) is a game developed by [Axolot Games AB](http://axolotgames.com/).

# Reporting issues after encounter
Before you create an [issue](https://github.com/Sheggies/sm-issues/issues), verify that your issue has not been reported already and avoid duplicates.

You should note that issues caused by modifications to the game's original shipping state will be rejected, regardless of the modification's nature.

## Reproducing and verifying the issue
When encountering an issue verify that the game installation has not been modified.
If there are changes, back them up and [verify the game's integrity](steam://validate/387990) with steam.

Starting from a clean state, try reproducing the earlier-encountered issue by recreating the steps leading to it while simultaneously taking notes. Simplify the reproduction process by taking the least amount of steps to recreate the issue.

## Writing the report
When writing the bug report follow this structure:

- Current behaviour
- Expected behaviour
- Recreating the issue
- Possible solution

Start by describing the current incorrect behaviour, following with the expected behaviour, and list the steps to reproduce it. If you know a possible solution, mention it!

As a last step, select the labels that match your issue and submit the issue.

Visit the [issues page](https://github.com/Sheggies/sm-issues/issues) for some examples. [Filter](https://github.com/Sheggies/sm-issues/issues?q=is:issue%20label:%22good%20first%20issue%22%20label:bug) for `is:issue label:bug label:"good first issue"`.

# Other types of issues
You can also create other issues refering different subjects than the game (e.g. the repository) by using the corresopnding labels.
